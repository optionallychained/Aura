# Project TODOs

- [x] Initialise testing
- [ ] Structuring for publish
    - [ ] consider: barrels?
    - [ ] consider: compilation target? - ESM/Common/maybe even just publish-as-TS?
    - [ ] consider: relative vs absolute imports for engine/demo (paths/aliases)
    - [ ] want: tree shaking for demo/consumer build
