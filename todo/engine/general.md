# General

- [ ] Unified error handling
    - [ ] Entity
        - [x] Component management
        - [ ] Construction verification
    - [ ] Game
        - [ ] System management
        - [ ] Data
        - [ ] State management
    - [x] WebGLRenderer
        - [x] GL API failures
    - [x] ShaderVariableResolver
        - [x] Resolver not found
        - [x] No value
        - [x] Register + Override misuse
        - [x] look at *Resolver.type in conjunction with decision on Entity->Component management; tweak handling as appropriate
    - [ ] State
        - [ ] Invalid Transition
    

- [ ] Defined/configurable asset (image/sound) detection + loading

- [ ] **Consider:** Observables for general use
    - ...see Input consideration
    - ...Entity Events, State Events, System Events/Interrupts...


- [ ] **Consider/Experiment:** Generification of 2D/3D Component/System/etc splits?
