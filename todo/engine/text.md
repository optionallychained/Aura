    - ...w/ EntityManager for actual implementation of strings?
    - ...look at ProtoGL.js

- [ ] Built-in spritesheet font (port from ProtoGL.js)
    - ...overrideable? (see asset discovery/loading approach)


- [ ] text rendering in 3D scenes


- [ ] (in tandem with UI/textboxes/panels)
    - [ ] Wrapping
    - [ ] Alignment
    - [ ] Emphasis?
