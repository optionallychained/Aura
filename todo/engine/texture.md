# Texture

- [ ] Look again at the whole implementation of textures
    - ...do we like the 3-supported-atlases idea?
        - ...per-Entity texture?
    - ...reference u_Texture hack in WebGLRenderer

- [ ] non-uniform Atlases?

- [ ] named cells?

- [ ] texture parameters/customisable texture format + loading + configuration

- [ ] error handling for texture atlas sampling out of bounds?

- [ ] **Research:** Cube Maps?

- [ ] **Consider/Experiment**: Per-face texture sampling for 3D shapes?
