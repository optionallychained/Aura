# Aura

[![NPM](https://badge.fury.io/js/aura.ts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/aura.ts)

Aura is a work-in-progress TypeScript/WebGL general-purpose game engine, designed to enable the swift implementation of both 2D and 3D browser games and providing a large base of built-in utility.

Built on the Entity-Component-System architecture and operating on the concept of distinct game States, Aura aims to enable a compartmentalised approach to game creation, supporting developments of varying complexity.

See [Aura-Template](https://github.com/jonnopon/Aura-Template) for getting up and running with Aura fast.

Goals:
- Zero (or close to) dependencies
- Simplistic and easy-to-approach API and project structure
- Flexible rendering engine, with support for custom Shaders and Components
- Large base of built-in utility, serving many use-cases out of the box
- Support for both 2D and 3D game creation
- Multiple input/control schemes (Keyboard/Mouse, Gamepad, Touch)
- Approachable documentation
- Comprehensive testing
- *Potentially*: Desktop and Mobile builds
