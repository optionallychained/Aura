# ProtoGL-TS

*o boi we doin' it*

# TODO

- [ ] port some utilities from ProtoGL-JS that're directly reusable
    - [ ] input
    - [ ] (some) math
- [ ] Reach implementation of basic render/input demo *(Canvas2D for now)*
- [ ] consider usage as an NPM package/library
    - [ ] research TS library creation
    - [ ] research + experiment with NPM package publication *(private)*
    - [ ] decisions on typedefs vs classes for certain utilities
    - [ ] try to set things up for this purpose going forward
- [ ] ...proceed
    - [ ] reconsider Math implementations; instanced/mutable? types only? statics? etc - consider ideal usage patterns

# Notes

- *(for now?)* designed only for include as an npm module
    - how best to go about supporting script include? - just build it differently I guess?
