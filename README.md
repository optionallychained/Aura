# ProtoGL-TS

[![NPM](https://badge.fury.io/js/protogl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/protogl)

ProtoGL-TS is a TypeScript game engine designed for the swift implementation of prototype WebGL browser games, providing a large base of built-in utility.

Built on the Entity-Component-System architecture and operating on the concept of distinct game states, ProtoGL-TS aims to enable a compartmentalised approach
to prototype creation, supporting developments of varying complexity.

See [ProtoGL-TS-Starter](https://github.com/jonnopon/ProtoGL-TS-Starter) for getting up and running with ProtoGL-TS fast.

Lofty/long-term Goals:
- Zero (or close to) dependencies
- Simplistic and easy-to-approach API and project structure
- Large base of built-in utility (geometry, components, systems, physics, text, UI, shaders, etc)
- 2D rendering with OpenGL *(...and canvas?)*
- 3D rendering with OpenGL
- Keyboard/Mouse, Gamepad, Touch support
- Solid documentation
- Automated testing
- Efficient and optimised builds
