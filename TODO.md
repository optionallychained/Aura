# TODO

- [x] **Step 1: Rough-and-ready kickstart (ProtoGL conceptual port)**
    - [x] Port some basic utilities from ProtoGL
        - [x] input
        - [x] (some) math
    - [x] Reach implementation of basic/rough render/input/game demo *(Canvas2D)*
        - [x] states
        - [x] frame deltas
        - [x] entities
        - [x] systems
        - [x] physics (movement)
        - [x] collision
        - [x] player-controlled movement

- [ ] **Step 2: Project Considerations**
    - [x] consider usage as an NPM package/library
        - [x] research TS library creation
        - [x] research + experiment with NPM package publication
        - [x] set up a protogl-starter type project for getting up and running fast
    - [x] consider usage as a bundled `<script>`
    - [ ] Initialise Documentation
        - [ ] Technical documentation
        - [ ] User/API documentation
    - [ ] Initialise Testing

- [ ] **Step 3: ...etc *(misc notes)***
    - [ ] reconsider Math implementations; instanced/mutable? types only? statics? etc
        - [ ] port math from ProtoGL-JS *as and when needed*
    - [ ] reconsider Input Management
        - [ ] event/emitter type implementation?
        - [ ] input buffering?
        - [ ] observables?
    - [ ] strongly consider: Observables as an underlying engine utility?
        - thinking prompts: input, entity events, state events, system interrupts, etc?
    - [ ] `this` scoping or other creative solutions for:
        - [ ] state tick
        - [ ] entity update
        - [ ] misc: AABBCollisionBox onCollision
    - [ ] OpenGL
    - [ ] Enums for built-in Component and System names?
    - [ ] type-safety for entity.getComponent()
    - [ ] keyboard input not working for dist?
        - seems to be an issue with (entity).hasComponent()

- [ ] **Step 4: Project considerations II**
    - [ ] re-re-reconsider structuring and publishing (after a cooldown period, head hurts)
        - [ ] barrels? - Yes/no? Single/multi?
        - [ ] TS Target - ESM? CommonJS?
        - [ ] bundling - Yes/no?
        - [ ] relative imports/absolute?
            - [ ] paths/aliases?
        - [ ] ensure tree shaking support for demo + consumers?
