# Renderer

WebGL rendering.


## TODO

- Buffer management improvements (associated: EntityManager)
    - Re-evaluate EntityManager/Renderer relationship
    - Index Arrays
    - split buffers + sub buffering
    - Investigate optimisations to vertexAttribPointer using bindAttribLocation
- Texture management improvements/re-work (associated: Texture)
- Full screen
- Resizing
- configurable GL global state where appropriate
- Consider automatic shader registration on use?


## Long-Term

- WebGL2
    - VAOs
    - GLSL
