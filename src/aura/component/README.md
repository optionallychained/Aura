# Component

Component representation for Entities.


## TODO


### General

- (at a later time) re-evaluate decorated-class approach for Component definition/management - especially use of 'object' type in Entity for components and use of .constructor.name in add()


### Specific

- Transform3D - reconsider compute matrix / implement gimbol-locked version (associated: Camera)
